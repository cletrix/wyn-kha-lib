# wyn-kha-lib
Mini libraries written for Haxe/Kha. Not required by Wyngine, but libraries were written with synergy in mind.

# Notes

- Currently all libraries only work on HTML5 and Android-Native.
- Each library has a README with installation steps and example usage. For more info, just look into the code files.

# TODO

- iOS version for all libraries
- Android-Java version for all libraries
- In-App Purchasing library
- Common utility library (e.g. Toast, Open URL, Generic share, Generic popups...)
