# wyn-kha-lib
Mini libraries written for Haxe/Kha. Not required by Wyngine, but libraries were written with synergy in mind.

# Notes

- Currently all libraries only work on HTML5 and/or Android-Native.
- Each library has a README with installation steps and example usage. For more info, just look into the code files.
- Each library is written as I need them. If the code looks complete, then I've probably used it in my game and it worked. If it doesn't, please create an issue and I'll look into it ASAP. Thank you. :D

# TODO

- iOS version for all libraries
- Android-Java version for all libraries
- In-App Purchasing library
- Common utility library (e.g. Toast, Open URL, Generic share, Generic popups...)
