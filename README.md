# wyn-kha-lib
Mini libraries written for Haxe/Kha. Not required by Wyngine, but libraries were written with synergy in mind.

# Notes

- Each library has a README with installation steps and example usage. For more info, just look into the haxe or native code.
- Each library is written as I need them. If the code looks complete, then I've probably used it in my game and it worked. If it doesn't, please create an issue and I'll look into it ASAP. Thank you. :D

# TODO

- ios target for IMA
- Android-Java version for all libraries
- GameCenter library
- In-App Purchasing library
- Common library (e.g. Toast, Generic share, Generic popups...)
